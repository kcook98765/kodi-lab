# Kodi Lab

Kodi Lab is a self-hosted environment for developing and testing isolated Kodi
installations. This repository is currently at the Phase 0 foundation stage;
it contains no Kodi runtime or control implementation.

[`docs/V1-SPEC.md`](docs/V1-SPEC.md) is the authoritative v1 product and
architecture specification. [`docs/PROJECT-HANDOFF.md`](docs/PROJECT-HANDOFF.md)
records the development host host baseline and coexistence constraints for development.

## Development

The supported development host baseline is Python 3.12 on Ubuntu 24.04.

```console
uv sync --dev
./scripts/check
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete local foundation
check and [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) for the
phased scope.
